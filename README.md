# NLP-based-AI-discourse-analysis
This study investigates how public sentiment and thematic framing of artificial intelligence (AI) have evolved in major English-language news media from 2012 to 2025. Amid rapid advancements like large language models, autonomous systems, and facial recognition, media narratives and ethical concerns are shifting. Yet, a comprehensive, data-driven understanding of these shifts is lacking. The project addresses four key research questions: (1) How has journalistic sentiment toward AI changed over time? (2) What dominant themes recur in AI news coverage, and how have they evolved? (3) How does sentiment vary across topics, such as generative AI vs. automation? (4) How well do modern transformer models (e.g., BERT) classify news sentiment compared to classical methods? By applying large-scale text mining, transformer-based sentiment analysis, and probabilistic topic modeling, the study aims to produce a more nuanced, longitudinal view of AI media coverage than traditional surveys or manual analysis can offer.
